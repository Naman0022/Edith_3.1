## Music Recommendation System
Built a cool music recommendation system that tailors itself to my taste! It uses the Gemini Pro API to analyze the kind of music I like and find similar songs. So basically, it acts like a musical mind reader, constantly suggesting new tracks I might dig. To make things even better, I hooked it up with VLC media player. Now, whenever the system recommends a song, it streams it right through VLC, all ad-free. No more interruptions, just a seamless flow of personalized music.
### Power of Parallel Computing
It can play music in a parallel without interepting the usual chat
# Edith-v2.1

## Transliteration
Transliteration refers to the method of mapping from one system of writing to another based on phonetic similarity.  
like  
kya -> क्या ->(eng)-> What  
and badhiya -> बढ़िया ->(eng)-> good  
It is currently in progress...wait fpr version-2.2 :)
